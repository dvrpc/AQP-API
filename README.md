# AQP API

This API creates and populates a database ("aqp") from data on air quality provided by [AirNow-Tech](https://www.airnowtech.org). It then makes the latest data for the Philadelphia area available via an endpoint, [api/aqp/latest/](https://cloud.dvrpc.org/api/aqp/latest/). 

It is deployed via the [cloud-ansible project](https://github.com/dvrpc/cloud-ansible).
